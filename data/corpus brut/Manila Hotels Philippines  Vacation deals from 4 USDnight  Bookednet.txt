City Guide: Discover the best of Manila


     Manila is a city constantly on the move.


     From action packed days to after-dark, it makes little difference to Manila being always on the move. The only marker of the transition when the moon replaces the sun is the world's most impressive sunsets when the go-go clubs take turns with bustling day celebrations and fairs.


    You should go to Manila to feel its cultural splendor. Be it a room in cheap hotel in Manila to luxury one we have collected them all at Booked.net. You should check out our maps, photos and secure forms before you book your stay.


    Along with the cultural diversity Manila is a very historic city. It’s very nexus sits inside 
Intramuros 
 meaning "within the walls". This is the area of the 15
th
 century Spanish settlement that was totally defeated by the following wars. Born from the ashes, Manila is back, but maintains tight links to the bygone days. The city mirrors its colonial period in the fort and St. Augustine Church, the old ruins reflect the WWII hit, while modern influences left a mark at its skyline.


    Even though the city's glorious past is seen miles away, architecture is still better up close. Attractions include;


- Baywalk, a linear 	park nearby Manila Bay


- Bonifacio Shrine, a 	shrine in honour of Andres Bonifacio, the Filipino who has won 	freedom for the country


- Malacañang Palace, 	the residence of the president of the Philippines


- Manila Metropolitan 	Theater, an art deco building by the Filipino architect Juan M. de 	Guzman Arellano


- National Museum of the Philippines, a museum shows collections from 	archaeology, arts


     Throughout its history Manila hasn't seen calm days. Established in 1571 by conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legaspi as the capitol of the colony "Filipinas", the city existed under foreign rule. The Chinese and Spanish came to capture the city and for the latter those efforts paid off with. Anyway, Manila found ways to profit from foreign presence with new churches and houses introduced to the city. After the Spanish came the British, but Manila was back to Spain as a condition of the 1763 Treaty of Paris.


     Manila was put on a bloody path of revolutions against foreigners with the publication of Dr. Jose Rizal's book 
Noli Me Tangere. 
Even though the author was sentenced to death by the Spanish government, the struggle for independence began. The locals almost succeeded when the war left the city in ruins.


     Recovery took a long time, but post-war Manila has re-discovered itself toward one of the most exiting cities in Southeast Asia. If you are traveling to Manila, you shouldn't expect a minute in calm instead you will face bustling, friendly and exhausting metropolis.


    Anyway, when Manila makes you tired with its energetic lifestyle there is always shelter in your hotel booked in advance at Booked.net.
