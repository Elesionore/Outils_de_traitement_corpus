The ultimate hotel guide on the best accommodation in Barcelona and the best places to stay in Barcelona


Barcelona is undoubtedly the cultural artistic epicenter of Catalonia, it stands as one of the most famous and visited destinations in Spain and, for many reasons, it has become popular in recent years.


Barcelona is a city full of history, art, festivals and impressive architecture that ranges from Roman times to the most rabid contemporaneity.


Renowned artists and architects, such as Gaudí, Dalí or Picasso, are some of those who brought majestic works to Barcelona, ​​making it what it is today: one of the most vibrant cities in Europe.


Barcelona is a destination that adapts to all tastes. From art fans to party junkies, they will be able to enjoy an amazing journey while staying in this beautiful city. Barcelona is a playground for artists and architects, famous for its magnificent churches, sculptures, Gothic buildings, cobbled streets, narrow medieval streets and colourful houses. And, of course, for its lively day and nightlife. With more than a million and a half inhabitants, it is divided into very different neighbourhoods.


Barcelona is one of the most touristic cities in the world and has a wide range of hotels for all budgets. As for the price of accommodation, Barcelona is not particularly expensive. The further away from the centre, the cheaper the accommodation will be. To help you plan your trip, in this guide I describe the most suitable areas and neighbourhoods to find accommodation in Barcelona.


You can find  good hotels for around 30 euros  somewhat far from the center. You can find 5-star hotels   from around  130 euros,  although the price depends a lot on the season and advance of the reservation. If you want good deals I recommend you book in advance as there is a high demand.

About GOTHIC QUARTER


The Gothic Quarter of Barcelona is part of the historic center of the city. It is built on the ancient Roman city and owes its name to the medieval architecture that is admired in its many palaces and churches.


Plaça Nova is a very popular place for travelers. It is home to the Gothic Cathedral of Santa Eulalia, known locally as La Seu, the Diocesan Museum, and the Episcopal Palace.


The cathedral is connected to Plaça de Sant Jaume by the Calle del Bisbe pedestrian street. This is a passage cut in time where you can admire the Palace of the Generalitat or a magnificent neo-Gothic balcony. Barcelona City Council is at the end of the alley, in Plaça de Sant Jaume.


If you go down from Plaza Catalunya towards the port along the Ramblas, you will arrive at Plaça Reial, one of the favorites of many tourists with its palm trees that give it a false oriental air. 


You can enjoy a moment of rest between visits in this place designed by the architect Daniel Molina, either in the Fountain of the Three Graces or in the terraces of the bars that surround the square. It is a very lively area, both day and night.


The Barri Gòtic is also very popular with travelers for its many shops. For example, the pedestrian avenue of Portal de l'Àngel is lined with souvenir shops, independent designer shops and fashion brands. 


It is also a pleasant area to eat on the go at a tapas bar or higher end restaurant. The George Orwell Square, which is very popular with locals, also offers the opportunity to have a drink or a local meal at attractive prices.


As you can deduce, the Gothic Quarter is an excellent place to stay in Barcelona. It is a very good choice since it will allow you to visit the city easily, you have a vast gastronomic and commercial offer, and you also have many places to go out at night.


On the other hand, there are a large number of accommodations of all kinds and for different budgets. The price-quality ratio is not the best since the prices are significantly higher than in other areas due to the high demand.

Hotels near Barcelona airport (BCN)


Barcelona Airport Terminal 2 (T2) is only 20 - 25 minutes by taxi from the city center and Terminal 1 (T1) is 30 - 35 minutes from the city center. Therefore, it is worth remembering that you will have a much greater accommodation option if you head to the city center. However, if proximity to the airport is your main concern, you will find many business-oriented hotels that are within a five to ten minute drive from the airport terminals.

Barcelona Beach Hotels


What you need to know about the beaches of Barcelona? First, they are very clean. Don't be embarrassed by the status of a millionaire city or a major port in the neighborhood - here deservedly hoists the Blue Flag, awarded for the purity of the waters and coast. Secondly, all Barcelona's bathing areas are well equipped: sun loungers and parasols can be rented (EUR 6-8 per day), a fresh shower or a toilet can be used free of charge. Moreover, a lot of cafes and restaurants are sheltered along the entire coast, so that hunger after splashing in the Mediterranean waters can be quickly satisfied.


Finally, almost along the entire 5-kilometer beach area is a wide promenade, where it is so cool to cut on rollers, bicycles or just choose a bench overlooking the sea and plunge into oblivion.


And perhaps the most important thing to know is chiringito. Behind the ominous name are the sweetest cafes with terraces, which are stuck along the entire coast literally every 200 m. Here you can drink ice sangria or mojito, have a snack, listen to nice music.
